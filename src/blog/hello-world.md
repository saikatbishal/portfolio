# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog section. This content is rendered from a **Markdown** file located in the `src/blog` directory.

## Features

- **Dynamic Loading**: New posts appear automatically when added to the folder.
- **Markdown Support**: Write in standard markdown.
- **Code Highlighting**: (Coming soon!)

```javascript
console.log("Hello from the blog!");
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
